[16May2025 00:13:19.581] [Server thread/ERROR] [net.minecraftforge.fml.loading.RuntimeDistCleaner/DISTXFORM]: Attempted to load class net/minecraft/client/color/block/BlockColors for invalid dist DEDICATED_SERVER
[16May2025 00:13:19.581] [Server thread/WARN] [Radium Class Analysis/]: Radium Class Analysis Error: Class com.ferreusveritas.dynamictrees.block.rooty.RootyBlock cannot be analysed, because getting declared methods crashes with RuntimeException: Attempted to load class net/minecraft/client/color/block/BlockColors for invalid dist DEDICATED_SERVER. This is usually caused by modded entities declaring methods that have a return type or parameter type that is annotated with @OnlyIn(Dist.CLIENT). Loading the type is not possible, because it only exists in the CLIENT environment. The recommended fix is to annotate the method with this argument or return type with the same annotation. Lithium handles this error by assuming the class cannot be included in some optimizations.
